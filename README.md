# Overview

---

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è **Problems**

Spotify uses multi-layered ML algorithm to recommend music to their users. But a lot of it‚Äôs **users are dissatisfied with the music that was recommended** to them. Most of them feels that it‚Äôs repetitive and boring.

Discovering new music could **help Spotify** **increase their user‚Äôs satisfaction and help content distribution.**

</aside>

<aside>
üí° **Solutions**

**Social Recommendation Feature**.

I incorporated social feature to the design that could help content recommendation and music discovery.

Spotify‚Äôs users will be able to discover new music through their peers.

# Research

---

This project was initiated from my personal dissatisfaction towards Spotify‚Äôs recommendation. It started from curiosity to understand how did Spotify served me wrong. It started from a humble question to a fun project. The humble question changed to **3 research question.**

## Research TL;DR

<aside>
1Ô∏è‚É£ **How Spotify recommend their content?**

Spotify uses a complex and multi layered ML neural network called BaRT to understand both the content and the users through various data points.

</aside>

<aside>
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Has Spotify‚Äôs BaRT served it‚Äôs purposes?**

I searched for user‚Äôs feedback from multiple online community forum. BaRT is not a perfect solution for discovering and exploring new music.

</aside>

<aside>
3Ô∏è‚É£ **What are the alternatives that we can use?**

I proposed a Social Feature or Interaction as an alternative to Algorithm based recommendation.

## Understanding the users

### 1. Music Discovery Behavior

Discovering music is distributing content. But everyone differs in how they discover music.
I identify a spectrum in discovering music based on user‚Äôs intention and openness to experience.

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/chair_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/chair_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **Passive**

**Little to no intention of discovering music**. Finds new music from BaRT algorithm, friends, or other media

</aside>

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/condense_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/condense_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **Conservative**

**Low openness to experience.** Prefer to listen to music that has familiarity to current taste

</aside>

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/search_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/search_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **Active**

**Low to high intention of discovering music**. Actively searching for new music from any source available

</aside>

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/share_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/share_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **Progressive**

**High openness to experience**. Willing to listen to unfamiliar music

</aside>

### 2. User Persona

With these 2 different end of spectrum, I managed to developed personas for each ends.

# Problem & Design Goal

---

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è **Problem**

Spotify rely heavily to BaRT algorithm for distributing content and helping users discover new music that they‚Äôd like. But in reality there‚Äôs a lot of dissatisfaction on what BaRT has recommend to it‚Äôs users.

</aside>

<aside>
üéØ **Goal**

Create HI-FI design on social recommendation feature that‚Äôs **inclusive to different discovery behavior**

</aside>

## How might we create a social recommendation feature?

The proposed Social Feature **consists of 3 crucial features**

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/search_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/search_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **Recommendation Hierarchy**

sub-pages based on hierarchy of content that is recommended to users

</aside>

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/network_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/network_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **Social recommendation IA**

integrate an IA that uses current data points to show contents in social recommendation page

</aside>

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/groups_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/groups_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **Dedicated Page for social recommendation**

a page dedicated to content that is endorsed by user‚Äôs friends

</aside>

# Design Choices

## 1. Recommendation Hierarchy

![aa.png](aa.png)

This hierarchy of sub-pages/section **provides option** for users to find best contents that suits their discovery behavior. To explain more about it take a look at the Social Recommendation IA.

## 2. Social Recommendation IA

![Spotify Alternative Music Discovery.png](Spotify_Alternative_Music_Discovery.png)

I proposed to use friend‚Äôs history to provide endorsement of content. Filtered through user‚Äôs data to provide hierarchy to fit user‚Äôs discovery style.

## 3. Dedicated Page for Social Recommendation

### a. Social Proofing

Social proofing is a way to show a content is being endorsed by someone from the social circle. Social media has different ways to show social proofs

I decided to go with the same approach to **incite familiarity** with other social apps.

![Frame 4sssss.png](Frame_4sssss.png)

### b. Initial Sketch

This sketch **shows the main page** that contains sections of sub-page, **specific sub-pages**, and the **first sketch of the IA**

![0 ite Rough sketch-min.jpeg](0_ite_Rough_sketch-min.jpeg)

This is the first sketch I had in mind. I didn‚Äôt bring any devices on me while I was on a coffee shop. Thus I sketched it on a zine the coffee shop provided.

### c. Iteration I

The 1st iteration consists of Social Recommendation Page (**called Friend Page**). Inside this page are sections of hierarchy recommendation that aims to provide recommendation based on user‚Äôs music discovery behavior. Each page linked to a detailed page of recommended content.

I used profile picture to show endorsement by user‚Äôs socials.

![1st ite.jpeg](1st_ite.jpeg)

### d. Iteration II

I ran a **workshop with 3 spotify users** to gain feedback from the 1st iteration.

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/thought-alert_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/thought-alert_gray.svg" width="40px" /> It felt messy, too many faces of socials endorsement. Confusing.

</aside>

From the feedback, I tried to find other design choice to provide endorsement information.

I also add couple more change

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **Endorsement Information**

I changed the endorsement information to be more simple

</aside>

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/groups_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/groups_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **Friend‚Äôs Detail Overlay**

With simplifying the endorsement information I need other way to provide the rest of information

</aside>

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/music-album_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/music-album_gray.svg" width="40px" />

**Friends Activity**

I integrate the friends activity feature from the desktop version

</aside>

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/playback-play_gray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/playback-play_gray.svg" width="40px" /> **Preview Overlay**

Following the Spotify latest update in UI, I implement the same UI as a preview
